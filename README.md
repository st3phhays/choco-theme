# Chocolatey choco-theme

**NOTE: This project is used on Chocolatey websites and is being released for the benefit of the community. While we endeavour to help and fix issues, it will be limited to GitHub issues, discussions and pull requests when we are able to.**

This repository holds all of the CSS, JS, images, and shared partial files that are used across many Chocolatey projects. 

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Setup Yarn

#### Install Yarn

Navigate to the root of your repository where you want the `node_modules` folder to be installed. Follow the directions at the below links:

1. https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install#install-corepack
1. https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install#initializing-your-project

A new `package.json` and `.yarnrc.yml` file will be generated after the above steps are complete.

#### Modify `.yarnrc.yml` File

In the newly generated `.yarnrc.yml` file, copy the following lines to the end of the document:

```
nodeLinker: node-modules
checksumBehavior: "update"
```

#### Modify `package.json` File

In the choco-theme repository, navigate to `getting-started/_package.json`, and copy the contents into the new `package.json` file that was just created in your project.

* Be sure not to change lines 2 and 3, as these are specific to your new project.
* Update the git information in the package.json file in your new project to the correct information.

#### Update `.gitignore` File

Add the following lines to the `.gitignore` file in your repository. Any file path containing `input` may need updated to your specific repository folder structure.

```
input/assets/css/
input/assets/js/
input/assets/fonts/
input/assets/images/global-shared/
input/global-partials/
apple-touch-*.png
favicon.ico
node_modules/
.pnp.*
.yarn/*
!.yarn/patches
!.yarn/plugins
!.yarn/releases
!.yarn/sdks
!.yarn/versions
```

### Step 2: Setup Gulp

#### Copy `gulpfile.js` File Into Your Repository

In the choco-theme repository, navigate to `getting-started/_gulpfile.js`, and copy the file into your new repository in the same directory as the `package.json` file. Change the name to `gulpfile.js`.

Depending on the new project setup, the variable paths in `gulpfile.js` may need updated. There is a block in `gulpfile.js` that should look similar to below:

```
const paths = {
    input: 'input/',
    assets: 'input/assets/',
    partials: 'input/global-partials',
    node_modules: 'node_modules/',
    theme: 'node_modules/choco-theme/'
};
```

#### Copy `bundleconfig.json` File Into Your Repository

In the choco-theme repository, navigate to `getting-started/_bundleconfig.json`, and copy the file into your new repository in the same directory as the `package.json` file. Change the name to `bundleconfig.json`.

In the bundle named `input/assets/js/chocolatey.bundle.js` you will need to modify the input file name to match the name of your project. Replace the `${projectName}` variable.

#### Create a New JavaScript File

In choco-theme, you will need to copy a file inside of `js/init` into the same folder and name it according to the project name, and the name that you chose for the `bundleconfig.json` file's input path in the step above.

At this point, an informed decision will need to be made about what JavaScript files from choco-theme need to be included in the project.

### Step 3: Run It!

#### Yarn

From the command line in the root of your repository where the `package.json` file is located, run the command:

```
yarn
```

This will generate the `node_modules` folder an install any dependencies.

#### Gulp

From the command line in the root of your repository where the `package.json` file is located, run the command:

```
gulp
```

This will generate all the CSS and JS and place images and global partials in the correct folders.

#### Include Assets in HTML

Directly before the closing `</head>` tag in your HTML document, include the following lines:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/chocolatey.bundle.min.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/chocolatey-head.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

Directly before the closing `</body>` tag in your HTML document, include the following lines:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=default,Array.prototype.includes,Array.prototype.find,Number.parseFloat%2CNumber.parse%2CNodeList.prototype.forEach%2CNumber.parseInt"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/chocolatey.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

File paths may need to be updated based on your project structure.

Given that everything succeeded, choco-theme is set up and ready to go!

### Custom JavaScript and TypeScript

Along with external libraries, choco-theme contains many individual custom JavaScript and TypeScript files. The functions have been split up in a way that allows them to be included if desired in any project, minimizing the need for them to be required. While the majority of choco-theme is JavaScript, it is now encouraged to write any new code in TypeScript and place it in the `js/ts` directory. This will be converted to JavaScript when running `gulp`.

### Custom CSS

While choco-theme utilizes the Bootstrap framework, many custom `.scss` files exist that further enhance the Chocolatey look and feel. 

All of the Bootstrap and custom Chocolatey `.scss` files are included in the build process. A `gulp` task is ran by the `purge-css` plugin that removes any unused rules. This significantly reduces the CSS footprint and maintainability.

### Global Partials

Global partials are imported on-demand by each project individually. They supply content that is used across multiple projects in an effort to reduce duplication of code.
